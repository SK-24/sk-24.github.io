    <p>
	 In my game there are two moveable characters. There is a Kangaroo and a DonkeyKong character. They both can move left, right and jump with the WASD and SPACE keys, they can also place down bombs to destroy their enemies(Snake and Lion). The aim of the game is to collect all the bananas, and leaves so you can go through all he portals and finish the game.
